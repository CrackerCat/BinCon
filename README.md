# BinCon
A library to assist with memory &amp; code protection. This is not meant to be a drop in replacement for anything, but as an example for how to provide an 
increased layer of protection on top of virtualization or code mutation.

The example project provides an example of a simple console application hardened against memory scans, memory modifications, debuggers, and other things.
